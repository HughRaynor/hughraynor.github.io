I am an NCSC accredited CHECK Team Member and <a href="https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/05167d13-d811-4389-880e-4061859e0bff/public_url">GIAC GICSP</a>, currently focused on infrastructure testing. I have strong interests in Industrial Control Systems/SCADA/Operational Technology; quantitative, technical assessments of information systems mapped to the NIST Cyber Security Framework; and Red Team scenario development and support.

I graduated from the University of Birmingham in 2018 with a BSc. in Computer Science.</p>

Outside of cyber security, I'm an avid fan of driving and motorsport. In my spare time I volunteer as a Local Observer for the <a href="https://www.iam-bristol.org.uk/">Bristol group of IAM RoadSmart</a>, formerly the Institute of Advanced Motorists.
